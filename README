Implementation of SPI master in VHDL. Code contains simple SPI master with variable clock and 3 slave-select lines. Folder /API contains C library allowing to use SPI functionality from xyllinux running on ARM cores of Zynq chip.


Guidelines:
1. Clone repo and add it to you IP core repository
2. Add axi_spi_v1.0 to your block design
3. Connect signals to pins of your Zynq chip
4. Open Address editor and find out base address of peripheral
5. Generate bitstream and setup your application
6. Use API and (in neccessarry) update base address to match yours


NOTE: When running bare metal, you can access registers directly, without mmap() just beware of offset 4 per register.
